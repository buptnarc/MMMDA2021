# About MMMDA

The management of patients with complex diseases, such as cancer, typically requires a multidisciplinary team approach, with each case discussed within a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Medical examinations often produce highly complex results, with multiple sequences of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) providing unique values for disease diagnosis. Therefore, multi-modal medical data analysis is crucial for accurate diagnosis. With the advancements in deep learning and multi-modal data analysis techniques, researchers are exploring a wide range of deep learning-based applications in medicine, including organ or lesion segmentation in medical images, disease data analysis, and more. This workshop will showcase recent advances in multi-modal medical data analysis, such as medical image processing (e.g., organ and lesion segmentation for MRI or CT), and medical text data mining. Furthermore, ideas, algorithms, and models originating from medical data are gradually being applied to other fields and have achieved positive results, such as the successful application of U-Net to scenarios like key point detection of industrial equipment. During the workshop, we will discuss key problems, common formulations, existing methodologies, real industrial applications, and future directions in these topics. Our workshop perspective combines the latest research findings with real-world requirements and experiences from the industrial community. Therefore, this workshop will inspire and benefit audiences from both academia and industry and facilitate research in multi-modal medical data for medical big data analysis modeling and extended applications.
